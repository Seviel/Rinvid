# Testing grounds

This is a special Rinvid example that is often updated. It is used for testing and showcasing latest features developed.

To run it, run the following command from inside Rinvid repo:

    bazel run //examples/testing_grounds:test

Note: this will build it first and after successful build it will run the application.
