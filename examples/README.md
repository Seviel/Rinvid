# Examples

This is where examples of usage of Rinvid are. Each example is a small application that demonstrates how to use a part of Rinvid. There is also one special example that resides in the testing_grounds directory. This is used by Rinvid developers to try out latest features developed. Usually, upon developing a new feature or part of a feature, a small test example is added to testing_grounds application, and after the feature is considered complete, a dedicated example application should be made.
